## 💡 <!-- lightbulb --> Project Description 
Modern technology allows the protection of sensitive information.​ Naturally, the presence of value leads to people with malicious intent.​ Currently, the file EPSB contains methods used to calculate the CR for a given set of passwords that all belong to a single user. This is a college project and is not intended for serious use.
<br>
<br>
**Our Research Goal:**
Develop an algorithm to detect malicious users using various metrics including the longest common substring for multiple strings algorithm.​
## 🏃 <!-- running --> How to Run
This EPSB class is demonstrated with the EPSB_CLI and EPSB_GUI classes. To run either class, please fork this repo, compile all files ("javac *.java"), and run either "java EPSB_CLI" or "java EPSB_GUI".
<br>
<br>
Included in this repo are multiple cvs files that (some of which are generated) that represent a users' possible passwords. You can see them if you run "java TextParser".
